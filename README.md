# Updatr

## Description
Updatr is a gLua library that allows the server to send updates on large tables without resending the entire table over the network. It does this by sending the difference between the old table and the new table and then applying the difference on the client.

This addon has not been tested on a large scale, so it may not be as efficient and as stable as it could be. If you find any bugs, please report them on the [issues](https://github.com/Pulsar-Dev/updatr/issues) page.
